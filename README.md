INTRODUCTION

This is a Frontend Code Repository for a random landing page of a Restaurant UI/UX Design (link: https://www.figma.com/file/yvClSI9AZBRX8UaaGEByF3/Modern-UI%2FUX%3A-Gericht?node-id=0%3A1) i found online that i decided to try my hands on so i could improve and as well deepen my understanding of React.

Every step of the project was an eye opener for me because i came across some terminologies i have not used in some of my prevous projects but have been applied here. Examples of what i learnt are listed below:-

React Functional components and their reusability
React file and folder structure
Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
And at the end you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.

Having undertaken this project as first, i am certainly going to try my hands on others and as many as i will find.

The final project can be viewed online here:-
